# 第一课 并列句

## 1.1 定义

所谓简单句，就是只有一个主干的句子，但可以存在各种定语、状语修饰的复杂情况。而并列句是所有英文长句中最简单的模式，就是由并列连词连接两个或两个以上简单句而成的句子。

复合句就是除主句外还包含一个或一个以上从句的句子。 

1. 引导词，连词名词性从句
2. 副词连词，连接状语从句
3. 关系词，连接定语从句

英语中，只要出现两个完整的句子，之间绝对不能出现逗号，而且必须由连词连接，或者把其中一个句子，化简为分词短语或不定式短语。

## 1.2 如何连接

并列句必须使用并列连词来连接，其中并列连词包括and、or、but，并列连词可以连接对等的句子或句子中任何对等的成分。

### 1.2.1 连接句子

"and": *I had just lost $50* **and** *I felt very upset*.

"but" : *The police had a difficult time*, **but** *they were most amused.*

"or"连接句子，通常用于祈使句，翻译为“否则”，注意祈使句中需要加上please或would you please 才可能达到中文祈使句的效果，不加的话表现为命令，会让人觉得非常傲慢。

1. *Obey your boss* **or** *you will be fired*
2. *Don't cheat at exams* **or** *others will despise you*.
3. Give me liberty **or** give me death.

### 1.2.2 连接句子中对等的成分

1. 连接主语：
   1. *A young man* **and** *a young woman* were sitting behind me.
   2. Either Thomas or I am going to call you tomorrow about the job. 并列连词连接名词做主语时，谓语动词的单复数与靠后面的名词一致。
2. 连接谓语：相对于是连接两个句子，省略了第二个句子的主语
   1. I visited museums and sat in public gardens.
   2. I entered the hotel manager's office and sat down
3. 连接谓语的时候，只要助动词相同，即可省略助动词
   1. After take off, we were flying low over the city **and** (were) slowly gaining height, when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport.
   2. Mary is very happy **but** John (is) very miserable.
   3. Experience is the father of wisdom, **and** memory (is) the mother.
   4. Reading makes a full man; conference  (makes) a ready man; **and** writing   (makes) an exact man.(conference和writing后面省略了makes)
4. 连接宾语:
   1. I looked at *the man* **and** *the woman* angrily.
   2. He asked me for *a meal* **and** *a glass of beer*.
5. 连接表语
   1. The railway station was *big*, *black* **and** *dark*.
   2. The explanation was *simple* **but** *very unusual*.
6. 连接宾补：He saw two thieves *rush out of a shop* **and** *run towards a waiting car*.
7. 连接定语：Pupils of the school, *old* **and** *new*, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion.
8. 连接状语:We shall all remember Mr. Page *for his patience and understanding* **and** *for the kindly encouragement*.

Attentions: 

1.  "or"连接对等成分时，通常翻译为“或者”
   1. They will *go to the zoo* **or** *play volleyball*.
   2. I want to have a talk with *Mr. Jones* **or** *Mr. Smith*.
2. "and"可以表示“然后”、“但是”、“那么”、“则”的意思
   1. I will *set my goal* **and** *work toward it*.
   2. *Idleness is sweet*, **and** *its consequences are cruel*.
   3. *Cease to struggle* **and** *you cease to live*.

# 第二课 名词性从句

##2.1 定义

所谓从句，两个句子合并成一个句子，但一个句子在另外一个句子里面做句子成分。而这个句子在另一个句子里面当名词使用，被称为“名词性从句”。

名词能在句子里面担任主语、宾语、表语、同位语的作用，名词性从句也能担当同样的位置，名词从句示意：

1. 主语从句：他让我很生气。<u>他不爱读书</u>让我很生气。
2. 宾语从句：他说<u>他是一个老师</u>。
3. 表语从句：这次环境污染事件的焦点是<u>那家化工厂是否长期违规生产</u>。
4. 同位语从句：我得到确切消息<u>我们的队伍赢得了比赛</u>。

名词性从句必须加上引导词，引导词一般包括that、if/whether、疑问词从句What/How/Who。

Example : **That** he doesn't like to study makes me angry.

##2.2 That从句

That从句：任何一个陈述句，前面加上引导词that就构成that从句，但作为宾语或者表语时可以省略。

Example：

1. That everyone may receive a moderate education is an object of vital importance.
2. Many people pretend (that) they understand modern art.
3. The most surprising thing about it, however, is (that) it can land anywhere : on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field.
4. No one could account for the fact **that** one of the boxes was extremely heavy.

Attention: 英语写作中为了避免头重脚轻，that从句作主语时，为了更紧凑，通常可用it作主语，而将真正的主语后置。

Example:

1. It was obvious that he was very embarrassed.
2. It is a curious coincidence that Mr. Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years.

当使用宾补动词（consider，deem，think，find，believe，表示认为。。是。。）时，需要利用it来替换主语从句。

翻译：我认为我们每天说英语是重要的：

1. Err：I think that we should speak English important.
2. Correct: I think it important that we should speak English.

Example：

1. I think it necessary that you do it at once. 
2. We find it necessary that we practice spoken English every day.

##2.3 If/Whether从句 

If/Whether从句：任何一个一般疑问句，前面加上引导词if/whether，就构成whether从句，但句子中be动词或助动词的位置需要还原成陈述句的语态。

一般疑问句的对话：

A：Will he come tomorrow？

B-err: I don't know will he come tomorrow.

B-correct: I don't know if he will come tomorrow.  

Example：

1. Whether they would support us was a problem.
2. He asked if Mr Gilbert's operation had been successful and the doctor told him that it had been.
3. On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech.

Attention：介词后面或者在or not 结构中，常用whether

1. My sister is only seven, but she always tells me whether my pictures are good or not.
2. I worry about whether I hurt his feeling.

##2.4 疑问词从句

疑问词从句构成方法与if/whether从句一样，只是将whether换成疑问词而已，句子必须改为陈述句语序。

疑问句对话：

A: When will he come?

B-err: I don't know when will he come.

B-correct: I don't know when he will come.

Example:

1. He then asked when Mr Gilbert would be allowed to go home and the doctor told him that he would have to stay in hospital for another two weeks.
2. The doctors have not yet decided how the woman died.
3. I have no idea what has happened to him.

##2.5 造句联系：

1. It hasn't been decided *yet* who will be in charge of this project.
2. It makes all of us exciting*(very excited)* that he will join this meeting*(come to the conference)*.
3. He told us that they will*(would)* help us finish all of the work*(the whole work)*.
4. I wonder if you can turn down your voice*(would mind making less noise)*.
5. I think it necessary that we should drink a lot of water every day.
6. I have no idea when they (will) come back and live in(settle down).
7. I have found that all the ticket(s) have(had) been sold out.
