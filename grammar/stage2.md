# 第一课 最简单的长句 并列句

## 定义

所谓简单句，就是只有一个主干的句子，但存在各种定语、状语修饰的复杂情况。

**并列句是所有英文长句中最简单的模式，就是由并列连词连接两个或两个以上简单句而成的句子。**

复合句就是除主句外还包含一个或一个以上从句的句子。 

- 引导词，连词名词性从句
- 副词连词，连接状语从句
- 关系词，连接定语从句

英语中，只要出现两个完整的句子，之间绝对不能出现都好，二十必须由连词连接，或者，把其中一个句子，化简为分词短语或不定式短语。

## 连接句子

并列句必须使用并列连词，其中并列连词有：and，or，but，可以连接对等的句子，或句子中任何对等的成分。

Example：

- *I had just lost $50* **and** *I felt very upset*.

- *The police had a difficult time*, **but** *they were most amused.*

or连接句子，通常用于祈使句，翻译为“否则”，注意祈使句加上please和would you please 才可能达到中文中祈使句的效果，不加会体现的非常傲慢。

- *Obey your boss* **or** *you will be fired*
- *Don't cheat at exams* **or** *others will despise you*.
- Give me liberty **or** give me death.

PS：中文中的“我想要”等同于“*I would like*”

## 连接句子中对等的成分

连接主语：

- *A young man* **and** *a young woman* were sitting behind me.
- Either Thomas or I am going to call you tomorrow about the job. 并列连词连接名词做主语时，谓语动词的单复数与靠后面的名词一致。

连接谓语：相对于是连接两个句子，省略了第二个句子的主语

- I *visited museums* **and** *sat in public gardens*.
- I *entered the hotel manager's office* **and** *sat down*.

连接谓语的时候，只要助动词相同，即可省略助动词

- After take off, we were flying low over the city **and** (were) slowly gaining height, when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport.
- Mary is very happy **but** John (is) very miserable.
- Experience is the father of wisdom, **and** memory (is) the mother.
- Reading makes a full man; conference  (makes) a ready man; **and** writing   (makes) an exact man.(conference和writing后面省略了makes)

连接宾语:

- I looked at *the man* **and** *the woman* angrily.
- He asked me for *a meal* **and** *a glass of beer*.

连接表语

- The railway station was *big*, *black* **and** *dark*.
- The explanation was *simple* **but** *very unusual*.

连接宾补：He saw two thieves *rush out of a shop* **and** *run towards a waiting car*.

连接定语：Pupils of the school, *old* **and** *new*, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion.

连接状语:We shall all remember Mr. Page *for his patience and understanding* **and** *for the kindly encouragement*.

PS: or连接对等成分时，通常翻译为或者

- They will *go to the zoo* **or** *play volleyball*.
- I want to have a talk with *Mr. Jones* **or** *Mr. Smith*.

PS: and也可以表示“然后”、“但是”、“那么”、“则”的意思

- I will *set my goal* **and** *work toward it*.
- *Idleness is sweet*, **and** *its consequences are cruel*.
- *Cease to struggle* **and** *you cease to live*.

## 由单一连词衍生的连接词，综合性连词

英式使用：not only...but...as well.

- He answered all the question **not only** quickly **but (also)** accurately.

。。。。和。。。。两者都 both...and...
